# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
  As requested from Bobby's manager, additional analysis has been performed on the upcoming wave of retiring employees to determine the impact the company as a whole. Additionally, employees eligible for the proposed mentorship program will be identified.

- While this will create a bit of knowledge loss, there are plenty of retiring employees that can be tapped for the mentorship program.
