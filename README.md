# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
  As requested from Bobby's manager, additional analysis has been performed on the upcoming wave of retiring employees to determine the impact the company as a whole. Additionally, employees eligible for the proposed mentorship program will be identified. This program will help to aleviate the potential knowledge loss that would otherwise accompany the "silver tsunami".
  
## Results
The first table requested was a grouping of the retirees by title. 

Retirees by Title:

The second table requested was that of current employees who will be the up and coming senior level once the current wave retires. A sample of this table is below:

- As seen in the Retirees by Title, the majority of retirees are senior engineers or senior staff. 
- While this will create a bit of knowledge loss, there are plenty of retiring employees that can be tapped for the mentorship program. See the table below for mentorship eligible employees by title.
- Based on Table Mentorship Eligibility by Title, once the "silver tsunami" has subsidded, there will be a significant decrease in the amount of approaching retirees.
- Finally, given that there are much fewer people in the "mentorship-eligible" group compared to those retiring, management should consider expanding mentorhsip eligibility to take more advantage of the retiring employees.

## Summary

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  - There are 90,398 positions that are going to be vacated. This is a large impacct... (Check the current_emp vs retiring employees tables. Something feels off. Total of current_emp should be > than retiring employees.)

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
